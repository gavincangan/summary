Research
========

### Coordination at Scale Lab - Research Assistant

Working on my thesis with **[Prof. Ryan Williams](https://autonomyandrobotics.centers.vt.edu/people/williams.html)** on an NSF-funded [multi-robot multi-human **search and rescue**](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1830414) research project.

- Developing an adaptive **multi-agent** human-in-the-loop **path planning** algorithm to enable coordination with human search teams.

### Biocomplexity Institute @VT - Research Assistant

Analyzing large volumes of genomic data and developing models to make threat predictions for the IARPA-funded **[FunGCAT](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/fun-gcat)** project.

- Built a model to predict Gene Ontology from amino acid sequences using **RNN**s

- Co-Taught an **Introduction to Machine Learning** undergraduate class

Projects
========

### Multi-Agent Path Planning using Conflict-based Search ([code](https://github.com/gavincangan/multiagent-pathfinding), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5KMm729b_4))

- Used space-time A\*-based search and conflict resolution to solve multi-agent pathfinding *\[Python\]*

### Adaptive Face Tracking in Unconstrained Videos ([code](https://github.com/gavincangan/AdaptiveFaceTracking))

- Tracking multiple faces in sitcom videos using a combination of face detection and optical flow tracking *\[Python + OpenCV, TensorFlow\]*

### Mapping and Tracking a Target using a Ground Robot ([code](https://github.com/gavincangan/bayesian-robotics) [video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrq85AiKQ1UQ7Xlcx6CEyrwCmWUAM_3p7))

- Fused camera and LIDAR sensor data to track an object using an Extended Kalman Filter and performed SLAM *\[Python + ROS, OpenCV\]*

### Quadrotor Wind-backwash Prediction ([code](https://github.com/gavincangan/wind-prediction))

- Used a combination IMU and RC data with stereo vision to learn to predict the effect of rotor wind backwash *\[Python + ROS, Keras\]*

### Learning to Explore in the Context of Multi-agent Shape Formation ([code](https://github.com/gavincangan/modelbased-shapeformation))

- Used model-based planning to solve a POMDP in a multi-agent system with limited sensing *\[Python + Keras\]*
